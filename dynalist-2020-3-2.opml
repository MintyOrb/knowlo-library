        <outline text="My bipolar - turns out it is cyclical:" collapsed="true">
          <outline text="Sorry in advance- this is going to be a bit of a long text-only post. I hope it does not come off as a rant...it&apos;s really more like an &quot;off-my-chest&quot; kind of thing (don&apos;t worry I have plenty of close friends / family to talk with as well :) ). I&apos;m simply very curious to hear from others with similar / different &quot;second-ever&quot; manic episodes."/>
          <outline text="I know many of you are not only well prepared, but much more highly attuned to your bipolar than I had been (I&apos;ve been lurking here quite a while...finally made a new account just so I could post this). However, I&apos;d like this, if possible, to serve as a kind of PSA to anyone that has had a single episode or who might be tempted into thinking that they could have a &quot;one-and-done&quot; type of bipolar. After eight years, I was certainly tempted to start think that..."/>
          <outline text="My first manic episode came in 2012 at the very end of my most intense semester ever while in university. It was ultimately fairly traumatic (though I have since worked though it). I was medicated for two years before weaning off and ultimately stopping my prescription (Tegretol / Carbamazepine). I won&apos;t say if I think this was a good or bad thing or if it played a role in my second episode because I honestly just don&apos;t know. Obviously having unmedicated bipolar disorder did (vastly?) increase my risk, though."/>
          <outline text="Over the last approximately three and a half years (I left the US the day after Trump was elected...coincidentally haha) I&apos;ve had the great privilege of being able to be location independent while making a living as a remote IT / Data Privacy &amp; Security consultant. In 2016, at the outset of my global travels, my bipolar was top-of mind...from my prior episode I knew that sleep and big transitional moments had the potential to be big triggers for me. Considering the disruption of dramatically changing time-zones, the fact that I would be traveling solo, and the introduction of new cultures / contexts, I think I was right to have some concern..."/>
          <outline text="Before leaving I visited a doctor (I didn&apos;t have a regular one at this point) just to consult. He ended up giving me a perception, at this point I don&apos;t even remember what for as I never ended up needing to take it, even with all the changes I already mentioned. After a year or so of travels with no issues, I ended up leaving the medication behind (both because I was feeling secure I had less of a need for it and it was close to or already had expired."/>
          <outline text="That brings us to the present."/>
          <outline text="I spent most of the month of February in Costa Rica. I went there with the intention of focusing on work and personal projects...I found a relatively cheap airbnb and set myself up in this tiny town and go to work. I became super intentional with my time, very regularly running (every other day), practicing mindfulness and medication (daily), and changing my sleep schedule to wake up with the sunrise. I was very balanced...at the beginning."/>
          <outline text="Throughout the month I was probably more productive than I ever had been in my life...generating and executing ideas at a higher rate than ever before. And I felt great....near the end of month I started feeling almost *too* good, and that was a sign of concern. Unfortunately, I had no plan in place whatsoever. I messaged my parents expressing my concern and over the next few days, my arousal spiraled out of control, culminating me failing to sleep wandering around in the early morning hours (none of which I directly remember)."/>
          <outline text="I was picked up by the police in the early morning hours and taken to the small clinic in town. There, I was given medication and slept for nearly 10 hours. The next day I was taken to a slightly larger town with a hospital where I slept more. Unfortunately, the dreams (and nightmares) I had while asleep in these locations were hyper lucid and I had great difficulty distinguishing them from reality, making it an utterly challenging experience. However, with great luck, I did not befall any catastrophic consequences and this episode was ultimately far less traumatic than my first."/>
          <outline text="My parents flew down and picked me up. Since I&apos;ve been back home (in the US) I&apos;ve been working on getting set up with a new psychiatrist and (virtual) therapist / counselor and have been managing my (still) slightly elevated symptoms. Being surrounded by friends, family, and familiar places has certainly been stabilizing, but have to wait until next month to be able to meet with my psychiatrist is a bit of a concern."/>
          <outline text="Please know nothing I&apos;ve said is meant to be taken as professional advice (...I&apos;m not a psychologist) or even as a recommendation. This is simply a personal request that you please please please, be careful. If you have bipolar type I (or II or even cyclothymia) and are currently relying on luck, please don&apos;t. I know that personally, I will be (and have been) taking steps to insure that luck plays no role in my future with bipolar insomuch as it is possible."/>
          <outline text="PS for Mods - I&apos;m not in a rush to have this posted and I&apos;ve tried to be intentional to keep out advice and PII (personally identifiable information). I know this account is new, but my intention is to use to regularly going forward. I do have a different account (~9 years old) I&apos;d be willing to verify with you. If there are other questions / concerns, I would love to address them as well."/>

          <outline text="4- Usted salió descalzo del apartamento probablemente como a las 5 am. Caminó hasta el Estadio de fútbol, acarició un perro, y estaba high (drogado)."/>
          <outline text="5- 7:30 am. Los maestros de la escuela llamaron a la policía porque usted estaba afuera de la escuela y se veía en mal estado. Usted NO hizo nada malo. Su aspecto físico no era saludable."/>
          <outline text="6- 7:45 am. Usted caminó de regreso al Apartamento pero NO lo encontró. La policía lo recogió a usted en la calle a solo 50 metros del apartamento. Usted puso resistencia al arresto. NO golpeó a ningún policía."/>

          <outline text="Luego usted se despertó pero continuaba con su mente perdida. Tomó agua y decía cosas incoherentes (ver videos). Tomó agua varías veces, comió un poco de comida, durmió 15 minutos más. Se despertó de nuevo. A las 3:30  pm aproximadamente se terminó de comer toda la comida y luego seguimos hablando, pero usted estaba con su mente perdida. Había una paciente en otra habitación y usted fue a hablarle. Luego usted salió corriendo de la habitación hacia la calle, se quitó la camisa ( como Hulk jajaj- esa parte fue divertida, perdón por reírme Tim 🙏). Yo fui por usted a la calle y hablé con usted, nos sentamos a ver el atardecer 5 minutos ( en el mismo lugar donde tomamos foto con sus padres) y usted observaba una piedra de la calle y hablaba incoherencias. Luego ( por dicha) usted entró tranquilo a la habitación en la clínica de salud y me dijo: quiero dormir. Yo acomodé las sábanas y usted se acostó a dormir. Se despertó como a las 5:00 pm y hablamos bien, pero el doctor decidió enviarlo a psiquiatría del Hospital en Liberia."/>

          <outline text="Hi Nichole! It&apos;s nice to meet you."/>
          <outline text="Since you&apos;ve provided such a large amount of preliminary and background information (for which I am very appreciative), I would like to do the same, providing sufficient context for us to have meaningful / relevant conversation right off the bat, if possible. This will ultimately be quite long- it&apos;s the first time I&apos;m writing it all out and I think it will be useful for me to go into considerable (relevant, I hope) detail. I believe providing this context will not only be useful for you, in understanding my situation, but also for me in reviewing my experiences with a bit of a magnifying glass."/>
          <outline text="I had my first (and prior to this, my only) manic episode at the end of my busiest-ever semester in college (at JMU, in VA), heading into the summer with big plans to go on a grand adventure in Germany and the Alps (the plane ticket had already been booked)."/>
          <outline text="Naturally, at the time I didn&apos;t know I had the disorder, which let to me not seeing the warning signs and falling for the common bipolar traps (flight of thoughts, delusions, becoming increasingly incoherent, etc.). "/>
          <outline text="I believe it was triggered by a combination of my excitement for the travel, grand enthusiasm for some ideas I had been thinking about, plus, suddenly having a lot of free time after the end of a jam-packed semester. Things took a turn when I smoked weed at a party. "/>
          <outline text="My thoughts began to spiral  and I didn&apos;t sleep for three days (having convinced myself I had figured out how to &apos;rest&apos; without sleeping). I was ultimately taken to the hospital by ambulance after a quite embarrassing psychotic display in the yard of my childhood home."/>
          <outline text="In the hospital, I continued failing to sleep and my condition continued to deteriorate, resulting in further trauma. I was discharged with a prescription to, I believe, Haldol, and later, an alternative to lithium, the name of which I can&apos;t remember at a the moment. I was ultimately on this alternative drug for about two years and haven&apos;t been medicated since."/>
          <outline text="For current context, over the last nearly three and half years, I have been travelling the globe while working as a remote Data Privacy &amp; Security Operations consultant (almost exclusively for the same company that I had worked for prior to my travels as a full-time employee). "/>
          <outline text="I&apos;m currently in Costa Rica, where I&apos;ve come to intentionally focus on thinking deeply about a few things...I&apos;ve been staying in the same apartment right around the past month (I arrived here on xxx )."/>
          <outline text="I was inspired to seek help when a very dear friend told me I needed to slam on the breaks. She also has bipolar disorder...we&apos;ve been talking with each other extensively over the last few weeks...to some degree checking-in with each other and keeping each other balanced, but almost certainly also feeding into each other&apos;s symptoms."/>
          <outline text="Since the moment I realized I needed professional help (at 3am this morning, when I couldn&apos;t sleep and felt like I didn&apos;t have sufficient control of my thoughts), I spent a lot of time today trying to shore up my support system and doing what I could to reduce my risk- for example, being highly intentional about avoiding things that elevate me as much as I can. I finally, thanks to Jo, had the realization that I needed to focus hard on getting myself to deescalate. Jo shared her wellness plan template with me and I started working on it (only when I was utterly calm), I got in touch with a therapist that I&apos;m planning to talk to tomorrow), and I&apos;m flying home on Thursday (to Virginia, where I grew up and still have old friends)."/>
          <outline text="I also thought a lot about coping mechanisms today and I seem to have found some things that seem to be working well for me so far, which I&apos;m hoping we can chat about a bit on our call."/>
          <outline text="I&apos;d also deeply appreciate getting your read of my state, your concerns, and your advice for how I should proceed. My schedule is nearly wide open."/>
          <outline text="As for my goals, I&apos;m afraid I don&apos;t have three that are distinct and articulated to work on over the next month...but my overarching goal (for the next month and beyond) is to maintain as much control as possible over my arousal and affect, and utterly avoid even approaching the edge of psychosis."/>

Every person that says they believe in a god would be talkign about something different, something unique to them and their specific experiences and biases. If the question is do I believe in physics, the answer is more than a lot of other things. If the question is __do I believe in a single master creator of the unvierse__ or __a old man in the sky__ or __adfa__ of course the answer is no. The answer of course gets trickeir when you talk about ... but when you . My tendency is always towards skepticism because I don&apos;t want to fool myself into a believe by resting it on faith and hope alone. The reason for a believe cant also be the belief itself.">
